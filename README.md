# Soil Categorization And Crop Recommendation

<br>

A deep learning model is trained with 1023 photos of four different types of soil for this project. "Alluvial," "Black," "Clay," and "Red." All photographs are curated and filtered using the Google Search Engine.

<br>

Crops will be suggested based on the type of soil.
